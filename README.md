# Lab Node Working with SPA Applications

In this lab, learners are walked through adding sign-on capabilities to a Single-Page Application, or SPA. By the end, the SPA will be integrated with Auth0 so that users can authenticate via the Universal Login Page.

## Requirements

1. A GitHub account: Our labs use GitHub Codespaces, so you'll need a GitHub account to access them. You can create a free account [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).
2. An Auth0 account: You'll also need an Auth0 account. If you do not already have one, you can create a free one [here](https://auth0.com/signup).

## Accessing and Working with Auth0 Labs

1. **Navigate to the lab repository:** Find the lab you want to work with and open its repository on GitHub. You can find a list of links for the labs in this course at the end of this document.
2. **Fork the lab to your GitHub account:** Click the "Fork" button located in the top right corner of the GitHub page. On the resulting page, under "Owner," select the dropdown menu and choose yourself as the owner for the forked repository. Then click the “Create fork” button. After a moment or two, you'll land on your fork of the repository. This fork now belongs to you, and you can revisit it later at any time.
3. **Open the lab in a Codespace:** From the “Code” dropdown menu, toggle to the Codespaces tab. Click the plus sign to create and open the lab in a Codespace. A new tab will open, and Codespaces will begin configuring the lab environment. Wait for the environment to finish building.
4. **Begin working with the lab:** Once the environment is ready you'll see a Codetour popup with instructions for connecting the lab to your Auth0 account. This can take some time, as the environment is installing several plugins to facilitate the lab. Once it is complete, you can open the Codetour to view all steps using the panel in the lower right. Follow the lab instructions (clicking to configure, selecting next, inserting code, etc.) in order to complete the lab.
